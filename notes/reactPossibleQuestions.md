🧠 React Core Concepts & Architecture

- Implement a custom version of useState and explain how it works internally.
- Build a mini version of useReducer and use it in a sample counter component.

- Create a usePrevious custom hook and explain its use cases.

- Build a controlled form input component with validation using hooks.

- Build a React component that persists state to localStorage using a custom hook.

- Create a reusable useDebounce hook and use it to debounce a search input.

- Build a useInterval hook that properly sets and clears intervals on component updates.

- Implement your own useEffectOnce hook that runs only on initial mount.

- Simulate the behavior of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount using useEffect.

- Create a hook called useEventListener that adds and cleans up an event listener.

⚙️ Advanced React Features

- Implement a higher-order component (HOC) that provides theme context to a component.

- Create a render-props-based component to manage toggle state (e.g., on/off).

- Build a React component using Portals to render a modal.

- Write a hook that uses the Intersection Observer API to implement infinite scroll.

- Create a component that implements error boundaries using class components.

- Write a custom hook to track window dimensions and re-render on resize.

- Build a context-based state management system (mini Redux alternative).

- Implement lazy loading for routes using React Router and React.lazy.

- Implement a component that tracks render count using refs.

- Use useImperativeHandle to expose methods from a child component to the parent.

⚡ React Performance & Optimization

- Implement memoization manually using React.memo and explain when it helps.

- Build a list component that only re-renders items that change (deep comparison).

- Use React.useCallback and React.useMemo in a performance-critical component.

- Create a large list renderer using windowing/virtualization (e.g., with react-window or from scratch).

- Track unnecessary re-renders of a component and log them (debug performance).

- Optimize a React app with many nested children by lifting state up and using memoization.

📦 React with TypeScript, Testing, and Ecosystem

- Write a typed custom hook in TypeScript for fetching data with axios.

- Write unit tests for a custom hook using React Testing Library.

- Create a reusable form component that accepts a schema for validation (integrate with Yup or Zod).

- Build a small React component library with reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Input, Modal) and demonstrate tree shaking.



- 1. Implement a concurrent mode simulation:

- Create a component that yields control back to the browser to keep the UI responsive during heavy computation (e.g., by - chunking rendering with requestIdleCallback or setTimeout).

- 2. Build a memoized virtualized list with dynamic row heights:

- Rows have different heights.

- Only visible rows render.

- Support scroll to index.

- 3. Implement a React reconciler for a custom renderer:

- Build a minimal React reconciler to render React elements into a canvas or terminal.

- 4. Create a custom Suspense component that can suspend and fallback manually without React’s built-in Suspense API.
- 5. Build a form builder:

- Generate dynamic forms from a JSON schema.

- Support nested fields and arrays.

- Support validation and conditional visibility.

- 6. Implement an undo/redo feature in a React app:

- Track state history.

- Enable undo and redo with keyboard shortcuts.

- 7. Build a complex drag-and-drop Kanban board:

- Drag cards between columns.

- Drag columns to reorder.

- Support nested subtasks inside cards.

- 8. Implement a React Profiler-like tool:

- Track and display render counts and durations for components in an app.

- 9. Write a custom renderer for React that targets WebGL or a non-DOM environment.
- 10. Build a React concurrent data fetching layer:

- Fetch multiple resources concurrently.

- Deduplicate requests.

- Cache results.

- Handle error and loading states gracefully.

- 11. Create a React scheduler for animations and smooth state transitions:

- Batch multiple state updates.

- Avoid layout thrashing.

- Prioritize urgent updates.

- 12. Implement server-side rendering (SSR) hydration for a React app without using frameworks.

- 13. Build a component library with theming and CSS-in-JS:

- Support dynamic themes.

- Optimize styles to avoid re-injection.

- 14. Create a React app with undoable Redux-like store supporting:

- Time travel debugging.

- Middleware.

- Async actions.

- 15. Implement React Context with selective updates:

- Only update consumers if the specific part of the context they use has changed.
